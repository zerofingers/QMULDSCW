all files that i have changed have been commented.
every other file that hasn't is from the lab2 starting point file, found here:
https://github.com/jdoyle314/ECS656U-796PLab2StartingPoint

-------------------------INITIAL SETUP HELP-------------------------

to get started you should probably watch the lab2 startup video, 
which can be found on the QM+ page under week 5 (REST):
https://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/mod/kalvidres/view.php?id=1886244
this in conjuction with the lab1 setup video,
which can be found on the QM+ page under week 2 (RPC, RMI and SOAP):
https://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/mod/kalvidres/view.php?id=1531652
will walk you through the GCP (Google Cloud Platform):
https://console.cloud.google.com/
setup. The rest is disclosed in the
README markdown (/README.md).

you can also create machine image templates which makes making lots
of servers easy and quick. When on the VM instance page on GCP, 
select the instance you've made from following week2 and week5 
tutorials and click on the vertical ... then click on "create 
machine image". Finally go to Machine images (on the side bar),
select the image you just created, select the vertical ... again
and click on "create instance". This is a quick way of creating the 
8 required instances.

note: you may have to add the tcp:9090 firewall rule to your GCP

----------------------------CODE IP SETUP--------------------------

inside the grpc-client\src\main\java\com\example\grpc\client\grpcclient\PingPongEndpoint.java
file on line 38 you will see a comment about changing the ips array to the ips of the 
server instances that you have made. from your GCP VM instance page after activating an instance
you can simply copy it's ip and replace localhost (localhost is used to debug on the local machine)

---------------------MATRIX UPLOADING + TESTING----------------------

inside the /matrices folder, there should be 3 matrix files. The way i have made the matrices is like so:

11-12-13-14;
15-16-17-18;
19-20-21-22;
23-24-25-26;

each value seperated by a - and each line seperated by a ;
when uploading the matices, feel free to use the matrices i have provided or make your own.


that should be it! it should just work.

finally, hope you enjoyed this year and the modules you picked :) you're graduating congratulations.
I knew you could do it! Wish you luck in your future endeavours, it was great talking to you i guess lol.
